# brickhit

A breakout-clone written in Clojure + LWJGL. This isn't supposed to be so much
of a polished game as my attempt at coding a game I am familiar with in a 
(hopefully) functional style.

## Usage

lein deps
lein run

That HOPEFULLY will work for you. If you have any problems you may need to copy
the files appropriate to your operating system in native/ to the top-level 
directory of brickhit before running. Let me know if there are any issues, or if
you can actually play this. I'd really appreciate it!
